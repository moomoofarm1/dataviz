- The **ggmosaic** package is recommended instead of **productplots** in most
  places.

# Spring 2021

- Several new *Worked Examples* have been added to the course. The source code
  for all of these worked examples has also been made available on the GitHub
  repository for the course.
- All of the reading assignments have been converted into quizzes.
- The initial "Post a Visualization" assignment has been removed.
- The workshops have been made weekly (instead of bi-weekly), and the duration
  has been shortened to one hour.
