## Fall 2021

## Spring 2021

Among the 19 respondents, one gave the course a "sufficient" score, 4 "very
good", and 14 "excellent". Most of the respondents were equally positive for
most other questions except for the one regarding literature, which was regarded
as "sufficient" by 2, "good" by 6, "very good" by 4, "excellent" by 5, and
"don't know" by 2. Everyone except one respondent reported that they spent
between 0 and 17 hours per week on the course. The mean amount of time spent
was just below 10 hours.

When it comes to constructive feedback, here are a few things that students
thought might improve the course:

- coding videos,
- more time for the project,
- more theory and tools for data wrangling,
- better overview of course content, and
- less assignments and quizzes in general.

## Fall 2020

Feedback on the course was positive across all items in the course evaluation.
We received one specific request, which was to make the workshops (help 
sessions) weekly instead of bi-weekly.
