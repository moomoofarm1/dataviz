## Fall 2021

### Feedback

Out of 19 respondents, one gave the course a "satisfactory" score,
5 "very good", and 13 "excellent". As before, most of the respondents
were equally positive for most of the other questions. The students
reported that they spent, on average, 13.1 hours of work each week on the
course.

As far as constructive feedback goes, the most common issue was
that people thought the course was too demanding for the amount of credits.
There were other suggestions and feedback as well, but none of it was
shared between the participants.

### Changes in Response to Feedback

Several of the more demanding quiz questions have now been removed and 
others have been simplified. A few smaller parts of the course have been
altogether removed. As a result, several of the lecture videos have been
revised.

## Spring 2021

### Feedback

Among the 19 respondents, one gave the course a "sufficient" score, 4 "very
good", and 14 "excellent". Most of the respondents were equally positive for
most other questions except for the one regarding literature, which was regarded
as "sufficient" by 2, "good" by 6, "very good" by 4, "excellent" by 5, and
"don't know" by 2. Everyone except one respondent reported that they spent
between 0 and 17 hours per week on the course. The mean amount of time spent
was just below 10 hours.

When it comes to constructive feedback, here are a few things that students
thought might improve the course:

- coding videos,
- more time for the project,
- more theory and tools for data wrangling,
- better overview of course content, and
- less assignments and quizzes in general.

### Changes in Response to Feedback

Several coding videos were added and also a course overview. Some of the
quiz questions were simplified or removed. One assignment was completely
remade and another majorly revised.

## Fall 2020

Feedback on the course was positive across all items in the course evaluation.
We received one specific request, which was to make the workshops (help 
sessions) weekly instead of bi-weekly.

### Changes in Response to Feedback

The workshops have been changed to be held on a weekly basis instead. Many
small changes to the course content and fixes to errors in the quizzes.
