# R Markdown

This document is written using [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). R
Markdown is a syntax for formatting documents that lets you focus on content.
You write text (including R code) in a standard text document with the ending
`.Rmd` and then R Markdown (plus a handful of very useful packages) turns your
text into a neatly formatted document.

The benefit of using R Markdown is that R Markdown documents can be output to a
myriad of formats, including PDFs, Word Documents, and HTML pages (and much
more) without having to change the content on your document.

This document has in fact been rendered as both a [PDF document]() and
[html page](), and you can read either of them. Furthermore, it may be
instructive to also look at the [source code used to create this document]() to
get a better feel for what R Markdown documents look like.

## Installation

To get started, you are going to need two packages: **rmarkdown** and **knitr**.
Run the following line of code to install these now. If you happen to be looking
at [the source code]() as you read this, you can simply highlight the text and
hit `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` or put the cursor inside the code chunk below and hit
`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Enter` to run the command (and install the packages).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("rmarkdown", "knitr"))
```

To produce PDF documents, you will also need a distribution of LaTeX. Installing
LaTeX can be installed easily using the **tinytex** package (if you don't
already have LaTeX installed). Do so now by calling the following lines of
code.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

After this, we also recommend that you set the options in
`Tools > Global Options > Sweave` in R Studio as in Figure 3.

![Suggested global options in R Studio.](images/rstudio-sweave-settings.png){width=300px}

## Your First R Markdown Document

For this course, we have provided a R Markdown template that provides better
defaults for your documents than the built-in ones. You can download the
template by clicking on [this
link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stat-lu/dataviz/main/template.Rmd),
right-clicking and choosing "Save page as".

Alternatively, you can download it your current working directory in R by
calling

```{r template, eval = FALSE}
download.file(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stat-lu/dataviz/main/template.Rmd",
  "template.Rmd", # destination, you can replace this if you want
  mode = "wb"
)
```

## Knitting

Now that you have LaTeX installed, you can turn the R Markdown template into a
PDF report by **knitting** it. To do so in R Studio, simply hit `Ctrl/Cmd +
Shift + k` with the file open.  Doing so will tell R to run through all of your
code blocks and text and pass this on to LaTeX to render your document into a
pdf file, which should open up on your screen. 

## YAML

Each Rmarkdown file starts with a so called YAML block; here is a bare-bones
one:

```yaml
---
title: "An Awesome Title"
author: "Fantastic Me"
date: "2020-09-28"
output: pdf_document
---
```

The YAML block contains settings that control the title block (title, author,
date) and options for the layout. For this course, please use the YAML block
supplied in this template, modifying only the `author`, `date`, 
and `title` fields.

## Formatting

R Markdown is an extension of
[Pandoc Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown), which uses a
special---but very simple---syntax for formatting text. The following are some
ways in which you can format text in R Markdown.


A contiguous block of text is treated as a **paragraph**. Separate paragraphs
with blank lines.

You can format text in italics, bold font, or monospace (fixed-width) fonts with
a few simple symbols (Table 1).

Table: Markdown text formatting.

markdown                    output
--------------------------  ---------------------------
`*italics*`                 *italics*
`**boldface**`              **boldface**
``typewriter (monospace)``  **typerwriter (monospace)**

### Sections

Sections are created by prefacing the section title with a hash tag (`#`):

```markdown
# One Hashtag Creates a Section

## Two Hashtags Creates a Sub-section

### Three Hastags Creates a Sub-sub-section

```

### Lists

To create (unnumbered) lists in markdown, you add a

```{markdown}
- dash before each item in the list, and
  - indent with two spaces for a sub-item.
* You can also use asterisks, and
  + plus signs.
```

The output looks like this:

- dash before each item in the list, and
  - indent with two spaces for a sub-item
* You can also use asterisks, and
  + plus signs.

Ordered lists are

```markdown
1. created similarly, but
2. use numbers or letters instead of dashes.
   a) It's easy to add sub-items too!
```

The output looks like this:

1. created similarly, but
2. using numbers or letters instead of dashes.
   a) It's easy to add sub-items too!

### Quotations

R Markdown can even format quotes for you!

```markdown
> If you want to quote something, adding a `>` before the text
  creates a block quote ---Johan Larsson
```

And it looks like this:

> If you want to quote something, adding a `>` before the text
  creates a block quote ---Johan Larsson

### Tables

There are [many ways](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL#tables) to format tables in
markdown, but the simplest one is two simply create columns of text with dashes
(`---`) separating the title of each column from the cells of the table.


```markdown
Table: A caption for the table can be added like this.

Header 1    Header 2
---------   ---------
Cell 1      Cell 2
Cell 3      Cell 4
```

Table 2 shows what the output looks like. 

Table: A caption for the table can be added like this.

Header 1    Header 2
---------   ---------
Cell 1      Cell 2
Cell 3      Cell 4

If the data you want to tabulate is already stored in an object in R, however,
it would be both tedious and error-prone to copy it by hand. A better
alternative is to then use `knitr::kable()` (or `kableExtra::kbl()`, which is
identical to the former but better documented).

### Links

To add a link in Markdown, you can either simply surround the URL with angled
brackets (`<>`) or square brackets (`[]`) and parantheses (`()`) (Table 3).

Table: Links in markdown

+------------------------------+----------------------------+
| markdown                     | output                     |
+==============================+============================+
| `<https://stat.lu.se>`       | <https://stat.lu.se>       |
+------------------------------+----------------------------+
| `[Link](https://stat.lu.se)` | [Link](https://stat.lu.se) |
+------------------------------+----------------------------+


### Images

Images can be added with syntax similar to the one for links, with the text
inside brackets indicating the caption for the figure. Provided that
we have stored a figure at `images/xkcd.png`, we can include it like this:

```markdown
![A caption (<https://xkcd.com/1945/>).](images/xkcd.png){width=300px}
```

![A caption (<https://xkcd.com/1945/>).](images/xkcd.png){width=300px}


### Footnotes

Footnotes can be useful to provide additional information^[If the footnote is
short, it is often best to write it in-line, like this.]. For a longer footnote,
it might be better to refer to it with a number[^1].

[^1]: Then you can add your text separately in the document.

### Citations

It is possible to add citations in R Markdown but this is somewhat complicated
if you are not familiar with Markdown and Pandoc. You will not be needing a lot
of references in this course, so it's perfectly alright to write your references
and citations manually; in this case, you can skip the next paragraph.

To cite in R Markdown, you will need either 1) a `.bib` file (with
bibtex-formatted references) somewhere in your working directory or 2) a
`references` field in the YAML block, like the following:

```{markdown}
references:
- id: wickham2010
  title: A Layered Grammar of Graphics
  author:
    - family: Wickham
      given: Hadley
  issued:
    year: 2010
    month: 1
  container-title: Journal of computational and graphical statistics
  volume: 19
  issue: 1
  page: 3-28
  DOI: 10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098
  URL: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098
  type: article-journal
```

Using a `.bib` file is recommended unless you only have a few references.

To cite something, find the key of the reference you are looking for---in this case
`wickham2010`, and preface it with an `@`. See the examples in Table 4.

Table: Citations in R Markdown.

type                  markdown                  output
------------------    -------------------       --------------
text citation         `@wickham2010`            @wickham2010
indirect deference    `[@wickham2010]`          [@wickham2010]

If you've done everything right, the final document will get a
bibliography at the end (as in this one).

## Code Chunks

So far we've only really talked about features that are made possible by pandoc
and its flavor of Markdown. But what makes R Markdown special is that is allows
us to write seamlessly include chunks of R code in our texts. This is a code
chunk that plots a simple plot using ggplot2:

````{markdown}
```{r chode-chunk-label}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(msleep, aes(brainwt, sleep_rem)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(x = "Brain Weight (lbs)", y = "REM Sleep (hours)")
```
````

As you can see, we've started the code chunk with ` ```{r} ` and ended it with
` ``` `. Everything in between will be treated as R code, just as if you would
have written in in an R script of the R terminal. When you compile this document
all this code will be run and if it produces any output (text, plot, tables)
then that output will make it into the final document.

### Chunk Settings

You can control many settings via the header of the code chunk (the content
between `{` and `}` in the first line of the code chunk). In the following chunk
we've changed the width and height of the figure as well as added a caption to
the figure. These are settings that will be **incredibly** useful to you during
the course.

```{r brain-figure, fig.cap = "Brain weight and REM sleep duration for mammals.", fig.width = 4, fig.height = 1.5}
ggplot(msleep, aes(brainwt, sleep_rem)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(x = "Brain Weight (kg)", y = "REM Sleep (hours)")
```

There are a few other settings that will also come in handy: `include`, `eval`,
`results`, `fig.show`, and `echo`.

`echo`
: Setting `echo = TRUE` means that the code in your code chunk will be included
  in the output (your pdf report). In this template, `echo` is set to `TRUE` by
  default (seethe first code hunk header "setup" in this document), but
  sometimes you onlywant the output of your code and not the code itself, which
  is often the case when you create figures.

`eval`
: Setting `eval = FALSE` means that the code in your code chunk will not be
  evaluated at all. This is often useful when you want to show how something is
  done (like installing a package) but don't want to do this every time you
  knit your document.

`results` and `fig.show`
: Setting either of these to `"hide"` means that the results generated from the
  code won't make it into the output (your pdf report); uses `results = "hide"`
  if you want to suppress code results and `fig.show = "hide"` if you want to
  suppress plots. This is sometimes useful if you want to run code interactively
  but not have it end up in your output. It can also be useful if the code you
  run produces output as a side-effect.

`include`
: Setting `include = FALSE` mean that the code will be evaluated but neither the
  output not the code will be included. This is equivalent to setting
  `echo = FALSE`, `eval = TRUE`, and `results = "hide"`.

Here are a couple of examples of these arguments (note that `echo = TRUE`,
`include = TRUE`, `eval = TRUE`, and `results = "show"` are the defaults):

```{r echo = FALSE}
# the code in this block will be evaluated and its results will be printed
# in the output, but the code will not show
rnorm(5)
```

```{r results = "hide"}
# this code block will show in the output,
# but the results of `rnorm(50)` will not
rnorm(5)
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# this code will not be evaluated at all
rnorm(5)
```

```{r include = FALSE, results = "show"}
# this code will be evaluated but nothing will show in the output
rnorm(5)
```

### Global Chunk Settings

The chunk settings for an R Markdown document can be modified globally. To do
so, you need to call the `knitr::opts_chunk$set()` function at the top of your
document. Inside the function, you set defaults for the various chunk arguments.
The following is the global settings for this document, which you'll also find
in the first chunk the `setup` chunk, in this document.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  warning = FALSE,
  message = FALSE,
  fig.align = "center",
  fig.width = 2.5,
  fig.height = 2.2
)
```

## Reproducibility and Automation

Authoring your documents using R Markdown facilitates reproducibility. Because
you need to supply all the code used to produce your paper in the `.Rmd` file,
this makes it much easier for other people to re-run your analysis and use your
code. It also means that your paper is now automated. Should you need to update
or modify your data, for instance, you will typically be able to generate your
final document simply by re-knitting it after having made your changes.

# Learning More About R Markdown

If you want to learn more about R Markdown, we recommend the [R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/install-latex.html). If
you run into any issues with R Markdown, please use the course's discussion
board on Canvas or search [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) with the
`[r-markdown]` or `[knitr]` tag.

# Troubleshooting

## Error: `'"pdflatex"' not found`

If you receive an error when knitting such as

```
Error: Failed to compile Test.tex.
In addition: Warning message:
In system2(..., stdout = FALSE, stderr = FALSE) : '"pdflatex"' not found
Execution halted
```

then please try running `tinytex:::install_prebuilt()`.

If this doesn't help, take a look at
<https://github.com/yihui/tinytex/issues/103> to see if any of the
suggested solutions there may help.

## Error: `/usr/local/bin not writable`

If you are on Mac OS X, you may be getting the following error (or
something like it) when
trying to run `tinytex::install_tinytex()`:

```shell
add_link_dir_dir: destination /usr/local/bin not writable,
no links from /Users/<user>/Library/TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-darwin.
tlmgr: An error has occurred. See above messages. Exiting.
```

In this case, try to run the following commands in your terminal:

```shell
sudo chown -R `whoami`:admin /usr/local/bin
```

followed by

```shell
~/Library/TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-darwin/tlmgr path add
```

If this doesn't work, have a look at
<https://github.com/yihui/tinytex/issues/24>, where this issue has been
discussed.

## I still cannot knit to `.pdf`!

As a last resort, you can change the output from pdf to Word document
instead. (But then you need to convert it to pdf before submitting.)

In this case, change the output section in the YAML front matter to
the following:

```r
output:
  word_document:
    number_sections: true
```
